This project is a group assignment on Computer Network, aimed to explain how hamming code works on network aspects to amateurs. It is coded by a trio from Tongji University, China. Feel free to contact us if any issues occur.

Make sure you have a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

## How To Run

### 1.Create React App
```Bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
dir

Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. You’ll need to have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. 

See [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) for more information. Or visit [React环境搭建教程](https://www.runoob.com/react/react-install.html) if you understand Chinese.
### 2.Clone The Project
After the previous step, you make a new directory "my-app" as your project directory. Overlay all the files and directories other than node_modules by the clone.

### 3.Install Yarn
```Bash
yarn 
```

### 3.Install Material-UI
```Bash
#with npm, but part of the code may not be compiled
npm install @material-ui/core 
#with yarn, recomonded
yarn add @material-ui/core
```

### 4.Enjoy

```Bash
yarn start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
